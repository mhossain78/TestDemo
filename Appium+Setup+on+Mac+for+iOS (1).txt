Important notes: 
- Use node LTS and not current version
- Use Appium latest and not some older version
- Be admin on your MAC
- If on corpnet (office laptop/computer), make sure anti-virus is not blocking node and Appium installation. Work with your security team in case of issues

1. Code signing WebDriverAgent: Basic (automatic/manual) configuration.
======================================================================

Step 1. Enroll for Developer program
- Create Apple account: https://developer.apple.com
- Enable two factor authentication: https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage
- Click Join the Apple Developer program
- Click Enroll
- Click Start Your Enrollment

Step 2. Register device UDID on the developer portal (this can be done from Xcode as well)

Step 3. Add your Apple ID (paid developer account) to XCode and download the certificate (if required, create new certificate on the developer portal)

Step 4. Generate UIKitCatalog IPA:
- Download UIKitCatalog app from https://github.com/appium/ios-uicatalog
- Launch project and code sign using Xcode managed provisioning profile
- Confirm wild card provisioning profile is created in the developer account
- (select generic iOS device) Archive app to generate IPA

Step 5. Create session with app using Appium Desktop server as well as CLI server
- Launch Appium Desktop, open inspector session, Set desired capabilities
"xcodeOrgId": "your team id"
"xcodeSigningId": "iPhone Developer"
- Launch Appium Desktop, open inspector session, point to CLI server, Set desired capabilities
"xcodeOrgId": "your team id"
"xcodeSigningId": "iPhone Developer"

2. Code signing WebDriverAgent: Full manual configuration path
==============================================================
Step 1. Add your Apple ID to XCode and download the certificate

Step 2. Find WebDriverAgent project
We will use Appium CLI version for test execution and point Appium Desktop to use CLI server for inspecting the app.
In terminal, execute command:
    $ where appium or which Appium
    /path/where/installed/bin/appium
WebDriverAgent project path:
Appium CLI:/path/where/installed/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent
Appium Desktop: /Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent

Step 3. Navigate to WebDriverAgent project path in terminal and run below command to setup the project

mkdir -p Resources/WebDriverAgent.bundle
    ./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d

Step 4. Open WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj in Xcode. For both the WebDriverAgentLib and WebDriverAgentRunner targets, select "Automatically manage signing" in the "General" tab, and then select your Development Team. This should also auto select Signing Certificate. 

Step 5. Manually change the bundle id for the target by going into the "Build Settings" tab, and changing the "Product Bundle Identifier" from com.facebook.WebDriverAgentRunner to 
something that Xcode will accept (something really unique!)

Step 6. Command to build the project:
xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner -destination 'id=<udid>' test -allowProvisioningUpdates

Step 7. Create session with app using Appium Inspector pointing to CLI server
